# Survival Report


## Synopsis - 85 Words

Due to recent events in climate and disease I have been assigned a task to find
a way for 10 people to survive 5+ years in a given location. I will have to find
ways to be self sutainable and find long term solutions to the following
criteria: food production, fibre production and water collection. To survive
long term we will have to go back and look at how the first nations people of
the Tiwi Islands found ways to survive for 65,000+ years.

## Location - 135 - 120

For this assignment I have chosen to attempt to survive on the Tiwi Islands
which begs the question, where on the Tiwi Islands do I plan to settle. On the
Tiwi Islands fire is a big risk in the dry season (March - August), using this
fire map that shows how fire prone areas on the Tiwi Islands are (Tiwi Land
Council, 2012). I chose to Settle in the North-East of Melville Island which is
the larger of the two islands (See Fig. 1). This location is one of the least
burned parts of the Tiwi Islands and is close enough to the coast and is next to
a river which will allow for a more diverse diet later on.

## Climate + Water - 135

The Tiwi Islands climate is fairly consistent because it is so close to the
equator, this makes it a lot easier to live on because you do not have to worry
about the cold or even the hot. The Tiwi Islands have 3 main seasons: Jamutakari
(the wet season), Kumunpunari (the dry season), and Tiyari (the warm, humid
season). This scenario will be starting in Jamutakari which is December through
to Febuary, in this season the weather is always over 30 degrees celcius in the
daytime and 25 degrees at night. The coldest Season in Kumunpunari where the
daytime temperatures still never drop below 30 degrees, only the temperature at
night can reach 18 degrees in July.

Collecting water will be a very important factor in surviving on the Tiwi
Islands. The later half of the Tiyari season through to the end of the
Kamutakari have reasonable amounts of rainfall. Additionally, the fresh river
water is also drinkable. The rainfall, river freshwater and additional first
nations water collecting techniques such as finding water in tree hollows and
rock holes (Waterwise Queensland, 2018)
