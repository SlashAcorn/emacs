# Survival Report

## Synopsis
Due to recent events in climate and disease I have been assigned a
task to find a way for 10 people to survive 5+ years in a given location. I will
have to find ways to be self sutainable and find long term solutions to: food
production, fibre production and water collection. To survive long term we will
have to go back and look at how the first nations people found ways to survive
for 65,000+ years.
