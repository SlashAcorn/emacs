# Survival Report


## Synopsis - 85 Words

Due to recent events in climate and disease I have been assigned a task to find
a way for 10 people to survive 5+ years in a given location. I will have to find
ways to be self sutainable and find long term solutions to the following
criteria: food production, fibre production and water collection. To survive
long term we will have to go back and look at how the first nations people of
the Tiwi Islands found ways to survive for 65,000+ years.

## Location - 135 - 120

For this assignment I have chosen to attempt to survive on the Tiwi Islands
which begs the question, where on the Tiwi Islands do I plan to settle. On the
Tiwi Islands fire is a big risk in the dry season (March - August), using this
fire map that shows how fire prone areas on the Tiwi Islands are (Tiwi Land
Council, 2012). I chose to Settle in the North-East of Melville Island which is
the larger of the two islands (See Fig. 1). This location is one of the least
burned parts of the Tiwi Islands and is close enough to the coast and is next to
a river which will allow for a more diverse diet later on.

## Climate + Water - 135 - 203

The Tiwi Islands climate is fairly consistent because it is so close to the
equator, this makes it a lot easier to live on because you do not have to worry
about the cold or even the hot. The Tiwi Islands have 3 main seasons: Jamutakari
(the wet season), Kumunpunari (the dry season), and Tiyari (the warm, humid
season). This scenario will be starting in Jamutakari which is December through
to Febuary, in this season the weather is always over 30 degrees celcius in the
daytime and 25 degrees at night. The coldest Season in Kumunpunari where the
daytime temperatures still never drop below 30 degrees, only the temperature at
night can reach 18 degrees in July.

Collecting water will be a very important factor in surviving on the Tiwi
Islands. The later half of the Tiyari season through to the end of the
Kamutakari have reasonable amounts of rainfall. Rainwater can be stored in tanks
which are covered to prevent evaporation, this would last throughout part of the
dry season. Additionally, the fresh river water is also drinkable. The rainfall,
river freshwater and additional first nations water collecting techniques such
as finding water in tree hollows and rock holes (Waterwise Queensland, 2018).


## Food - 135 - 178

The Tiwi Islands has a wide variety of foods available in different seasons. A
Tiwi Islands diet would primarily consist of seafood, native plants and some
animals. Seafood and other animals would be hunted and cooked over fire started
using the first nations drill method where a stick is twirled with two hands
onto another peice of wood covered in tinder (David M Welch). Each of the three
main Tiwi Island seasons have vastly different diets depending on what food is
available during that time. For example, the Jamutakari season has a diet of
fish and fruits because it is the wet season so the rivers are full of fish and
the fruits are blooming. The Kumunpunari season is the dryest season and so the
diet revolves around root vegetables, mussels and long neck turles. The Tiyari
season is warm and humid and the diet is more carnivorous, there are less plants
to chose from such as cycads and native peanuts, there are far more animals to
chose from though, such as dugong, magpie geese and whistling duck.

## Survival Plan - 300

After arriving at the Tiwi Islands fleeing the possibility of catching the
disease, we would have to work on getting things set up in order of importance.
(We will be starting in January which is the Jamutakari season) The most
important task at the beginning will be to set up shelter. We can dedicate a few
people to building a few small shelters with gutters connected to rainwater
tanks. The Jamutakari season is the easiest season to survive in because of the
large amounts of rainfall and easy to obtain fruit and fish. The next priority
would be starting a campfire for light, to cook and to clean river water. A
campfire would be started with the First Nations drill fire starting method.
Water is the next most important living requirement, not very much shelter would
have finished construction by the first night so we will be in tents and without
much water in the tanks. There would be some water collected with the amount of
rain in the Jamutakari season but there wouldn't be enough for 10 people, this
would mean we would have to search tree hollows and clean the river water with
the fire.
