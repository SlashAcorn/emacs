# Survival Report


## Synopsis - 85 Words

Due to recent events in climate and disease I have been assigned a task to find
a way for 10 people to survive 5+ years in a given location. I will have to find
ways to be self sutainable and find long term solutions to the following
criteria: food production, fibre production and water collection. To survive
long term we will have to go back and look at how the first nations people of
the Tiwi Islands found ways to survive for 65,000+ years.

## Location - 135

For this assignment I have chosen to attempt to survive on the Tiwi Islands
which begs the question, where on the Tiwi Islands do I plan to settle. On the
Tiwi Islands fire is a big risk in the dry season (March - August), using this
fire map that shows how fire prone areas on the Tiwi Islands are (Tiwi Land Council, 2012). I chose to Settle in the North-East of
Melville Island which is the larger of the two islands (See Fig. 1). This
location is one of the least burned parts of the Tiwi Islands and is close
enough to the coast and is next to a river which will allow for a more diverse
diet later on.
